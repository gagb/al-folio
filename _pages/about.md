I am fifth graduate student at the Allen School of the University of Washington, Seattle where I conduct interdiscipliary research on artificial intelligence, machine learning, and human-computer interaction. I am a part of the [UW CrowdLab](https://crowdlab.cs.washington.edu) where I am advised by [Dan Weld](https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~weld){:target="\_blank"}.

My current research interests span topics such as human-centered machine learning, explainable AI, and human-AI collaboration to AI develop systems that consider and improve human performance. which is crucial to developing AI systems that interact with people. I am interested in both the algorithimic and interfaces sides.

If you are a UW CSE undergraduate/masters students and interested in conducting research on human-centered machine learning, please send me an email!
